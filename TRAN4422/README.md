This is a directory for my Practicum in Translation 1 Course

The assignments are mainly a series of Japanese Articles referred to as Tensei Jingo
Each assignment consists of 
* Japanese Source Text
* A rough draft with transcribed japanese and translated english 
* An initial (or final) draft of translation with just english
* Possibly a revision
